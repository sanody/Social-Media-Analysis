Fundamentally, “computer science is a science of abstraction.” Computer scientists must create abstractions of real-world problems that can be represented and manipulated in a computer.  Graph Theory is a relatively new area of mathematics, first studied by the super famous mathematician Leonhard Euler in 1735. Since then it has blossomed into a powerful tool used in nearly every branch of science and is currently an active area of mathematics research. A graph is a set of points (we call them vertices or nodes) connected by lines (edges or arcs).  Some of the applications of graph theory are: Networks: A network consists of sites that send and receive messages of various types. Maps: A map consists of places that are connected by roads. Social Media platforms: The relations (friendship) among users can be modeled as a graph of nodes and edges.
